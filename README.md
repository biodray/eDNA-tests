# eDNA-tests
Trying various options of eDNA pipelines

## Code

### Before starting an analysis

**Change_PARAM.R** to modify repertories and files names

**Rename_RAW.R** to unzip fastq files and rename them

### Pipelines

**Assign_SP**

## Stuff to do eventually

- enable doing more analysis under windows
- change yes/no question in Process_RAW.R
- Add more info in Process_RAW.R log file
- Check for transpose OTU or ASV table ...
