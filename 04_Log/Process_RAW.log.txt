-------------------------

FastQC analysis was performed:
./01_Results/02_ReadsQ/FastQC_Raw

-------------------------

FastQC results were aggregated:
./01_Results/02_ReadsQ
./01_Results/01_data/FastQC.data

-------------------------

12S adapters were removed with cutadapt:
./00_Data/02a_Cutadapt
./00_Data/02a_Cutadapt/log

-------------------------

cytB adapters were removed with cutadapt:
./00_Data/02a_Cutadapt

-------------------------

Quality filtering was performed with dada2:
./00_Data/02b_Filtered_dada2
./01_Results/01_data/dada2.filt.data

-------------------------

Filt data quality were replot and saved:
./01_Results/01_data/Qplot.FILT.data

-------------------------

Dada2 error rate assement was performed and graph were saved:
01_Results/ErrorsRate.dada2.12S.pdf
01_Results/ErrorsRate.dada2.CYTB.pdf

-------------------------

Dada2 dereplication was performed.


Dada2 sample inference was performed.


Dada2 samples were merged for 12s.


Sequence tables were created and chimeric sequences were removed.


Data were saved:
./01_Results/01_data/ASVtable.data
./01_Results/01_data/dada2.data

-------------------------

12S sequence were merged with usearch.


Merged sequences were filtered by length.


Sequences were dereplicated:
./00_Data/04c_Derep_vsearch
./00_Data/04d_Derep_united_vsearch


OTU tables were created:
./00_Data/04e_OTU
./00_Data/04f_Compared_OTU
./01_Results/01_data/OTUtable.data
